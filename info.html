    <p>By 1957 there were 30 Holiday Inns, and Wilson began marketing the chain as "Holiday Inn of America". There were 50 locations 
        across the US by 1958, 100 by 1959, 500 by 1964, and 1000 in 1968. 
        A number of early locations were franchised, some by the Albert Pick corporation of Chicago.
         Because a number of Albert Pick franchisees were recommending customers to other Albert Pick hotels instead of to Holiday Inn,
          the Holiday Inn corporation enacted a rule that franchisees could not own locations of another hotel as well as a Holiday Inn.
         This led to the Albert Pick-franchised locations exiting the brand by the end of the 1950s.
         The rule on franchising remained until 1973, when a franchisee was denied the rights to build a location in Newark, New Jersey because of this rule; the United States District Court thus declared the rule a violation of a United States anti-monopoly law.</p>
